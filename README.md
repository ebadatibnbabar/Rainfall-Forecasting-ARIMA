# Rainfall Forecasting using ARIMA Model
Application of the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to forecast rainfall patterns. Leveraging time-series analysis techniques, it predicts future rainfall levels by analyzing historical data specifically from Bahwalnagar District, Punjab, Pakistan. Additionally, this project aids in anticipating drought patterns across the region.
